# Lossy Channel System (LCS)

LCS are just another name for CSM with unbounded p2p lossy FIFO channels.


## Embedding on words and Monotonicity

Let us recall some results seen in [notes 4](notes_4.md).

Let `w₁` and `w₂` be two finite sequences/words.
`w₁` is a _subsequence_ of `w₂` if it is possible to obtain `w₁` from by deleting some characters of `w₂`.
More formally, there is an injective mapping `f` from `[0, |w₂|)` to `[0, |w₁|)` such that:
*  `∀ i j. i < j ⇒ f(i) < f(j)`
*  `∀ i. w₁[i] = w₂[f(i)]`

For instance:
* `0110` is a subsequence of `01010101` with the following mapping: `(0→0), (1→1), (2→3), (3→6)`.
* `0110` is not a subsequence of `10100`.

We can generalize the subsequence relation to _embedding_ by relaxing the second condition to `≤` instead of `=`.
However, since we will apply the embedding on channels with a finite number of different messages, `=` will be sufficient.

__Higman's lemma.__
The embedding relation over finite sequences of well-quasi-ordered elements is a WQO.

__Corollary.__
Given a finite alphabet `Σ`, the subsequence ordering is a WQO.

_Proof._
`(Σ,=)` is a WQO and applying Higman's lemma give the WQO `(Σ*,≤)`.


The subsequence will form the basis of the WQO for LCS.

__Proposition.__
Let `i` be a process in a LCS with the word `w₁` as the content of an incoming channel and let `w₂` be a word such that `w₁ ≤ w₂`.
Form a state where the content of a channel is `w₂` it is possible to apply the transition rule for losing message to get to a state where the content of the channel is `w₁`.

_Proof._
* If `w₁ = w₂` we are done. Let us look at the case `w₁ < w₂`
* Because of `w₁ ≤ w₂` and they are finite words, `w₂` has a finite number of extra characters. Let us call this number `n`.
* Using the definition of subsequence and `w₁ ≤ w₂`, let `j` be the smallest index such that `∃ i. f(i) < j ∧ j < f(i+1)`, i.e., `j` is the first index of `w₂` that is not in `w₁`.
* By applying the dropping message rule on the characters at position `j`, we get `w₂′` such that `w₁ ≤ w₂′ < w₂` and `w₁`, `w₂′` differ at `n-1` position.
* Repeating the two steps above `n-1` more times finishes the proof.


## LCS are WSTS

The main idea is in the corollary and proposition above.
However, to show that LCS are WSTS we need to build `(S,→,≤)` to match the definition of WSTS.

__Theorem.__
LCS are WSTS.

_Proof._
1. Consider a LCS as some CSM `(Σ, ⋃_{i∈[1;N]} M_i)` with unbounded p2p lossy FIFO channels, we need to build a WSTS `(S,→,≤)`.
  * The (infinite) set of space `S` is the set `∏_i S_i × ∏_{i,j} Σ` where `i`,`j` ranges from `1` to `N` and `S_i` is the set of states of machine `M_i`. Note that this corresponds of `(M,C)` we saw in [week 7](notes_7.md).
  * The transition relation `→` is the relation defined by the send, receive, and message loss rules, i.e., `(C,M) → (C′,M′)` can derived using the "Lossy p2p FIFO" inference rule from [notes 7](notes_7.md).
  * `(M₁,C₁) ≤ (M₂,C₂)` iff `M₁ = M₂` and `∀ i,j. C₁(i,j) ≤ C₂(i,j)`.
2. `≤` is a WQO because `M` is a finite tuple of finite states, each `C(i,j)` is a WQO by Higman's lemma and we put everything together using Dickson's lemma.
3. Using the proposition above on each channel, we get stuttering compatibility.


Showing that LCS are WSTS is enough to give decidability of the covering problem using the backward algorithm, assuming an algorithm to compute the predecessor basis.


## Forward analysis of LCS

To have more efficient analysis of LCS people have looked at representation of downward-closed sets for LCS.


### Regular expressions

A regular expression `R` over the alphabet `Σ` is defined by the following grammar:
```
R ::= ε         (empty string)
    | a         (letter a ∈ Σ)
    | R R       (concatenation)
    | R + R     (alternation/choice/sum, also written R|R)
    | R*        (finite repetition)
```

Regular expressions have the same expressive power as finite automata.

A language is regular iff it can be described by a regular expression.

_Example._
The regular expression `a(ba)*` is equivalent to the DFA:

```
         a
→  (( )) ⇄  ( )
         b
```

You can find more information about regular expression in books like

### Revisiting the link between upward-closed and downward-closed sets

Rather than representing a set by the element is contains, we can represent a set by the elements it does not contain.

__Theorem.__
Let `(X,≤)` be a WQO.
The complement of an upward-closed set `U ⊆ X` is downward-closed.

_Proof._
* Let `D` be the complement of `U` (`D = X ∖ U`) with `U = ↑U`
* By contradiction, assume that `D ≠ ↓D`
* By definition of the downward-closure `D ⊆ ↓D` and, therefore, `↓D ⊈ D`
* Because `↓D ⊈ D`, there is an element `x` with `x∈ ↓D` and `x ∉ D`
* By definition of `↓D` and `x ∈ ↓D`, there exists `y ∈ D` with `x ≤ y`
* Because `U` is the complement of `D` and `x ∉ D`, we have that `x ∈ U`
* Since `U = ↑U` and `x ≤ y`, we have `y ∈ U`.
* Therefore, `y ∈ D`, `y ∈ U`, and `D ≠ X ∖ U`. This is a contradiction.

Since `U` is upward-closed, it can be represented by a finite basis and we can implicitly represent downward-closed sets.
Unfortunately, this is usually not an efficient representation.
The proof is non-constructive (proof by contradiction), i.e., it does not give an algorithm to construct `U` for a given `D`.

However, it will help us prove some theorems in the next section.


### The downward/upward closure of any language is regular

Let `(Σ*,≤)` be the set of words over `Σ` ordered by subsequence.
A language `L` is a set words (`L ⊆ Σ*`).

The next results are from [On free monoids partially ordered by embedding](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021980069801110) by Leonard H. Haines in Journal of Combinatorial Theory 1969.

__Proposition.__
The upward-closure of a word `w` is a regular language.

_Proof sketch._
Let `w = a₁ a₂ … a_n`, the upward closure of `w` can be described by the regular expression: `Σ* a₁ Σ* a₂ Σ* … a_n Σ*`.


__Theorem.__
The upward/downward-closed language are regular languages.

_Proof._
1. upward-closed case:
  * Let `L` be an upward-closed language.
  * By the finite-basis property of upward-closed sets, `L` can be represented by the upward-closure of a finite number of elements:`L = ⋃_i ↑w_i` with `i ∈ [1;n]`.
  * Each `↑w_i` is regular by the proposition above. Let `r_i` be the regular expression corresponding to `↑w_i`
  * `L = r₁ + r₂ + … + r_n`.
2. downward-closed case:
  * Let `L` be an downward-closed language.
  * `Σ* ∖ L` is downward-closed by the theorem above.
  * `Σ* ∖ L` is regular by the upward-closed case of this theorem.
  * Because regular languages are closed under complementation, `L` is also regular.


_Remark._
To get the complement of a regular expression, we need to:
1. convert the regular expression to an NFA,
2. determinize the NFA to get a DFA,
3. compute the complement of the DFA,
4. convert the complemented DFA to a regular expression.
This procedure is worst case doubly exponential.
Both the determinization and the conversion to regular expressions have an exponential worst case complexity.

_Remark._
Even though the upward/downward closure of any language is regular.
Computing the closure is not always a decidable problem.

### Simple Regular Expressions (SRE)

A SRE is a restricted form of regular expression introduced in [On-the-Fly Analysis of Systems with Unbounded, Lossy Fifo Channels](https://www.irif.fr/~abou/lcs-cav98.ps.gz) by P. Abdulla, A. Bouajjani, and B. Jonsson in CAV 98.

#### Definitions

An _atomic expression_ is one of the following two alternatives:
- `(a + ε)`  with `a ∈ Σ`
- `(a₁ + … + a_n)*`  with `∀ i∈[1;n]. a_i ∈ Σ`

A _product_ is a (possibility empty) concatenation of atomic expressions: `e₁ e₂ … e_n`.
The empty product is `ε`.

A _SRE_ is a (possibility empty) sum of products: `p₁ + p₂ + … + p_n`.
The empty product is written as `∅` (empty language).

__Theorem.__
A language `L` is downward-closed iff it can be described by an SRE.

The [paper](https://www.irif.fr/~abou/lcs-cav98.ps.gz) propose a proof by induction on the structure of regular expressions, at each step giving an SRE for the downward-closure.
However, we can do better with what we have already seen.

__Lemma.__
Products are ideals.

_Proof sketch of the Lemma._
* A product `p` is downward-closed:
  - atomic expressions are downward-closed and, thus, contain `ε`.
  - Given two words `w₁ ≤ w₂`, if `w₂` recognized by `p` then `w₁` is also recognized by `p`.
    By definition of subsequence, `w₁` can be obtained from `w₂` by earsing a finite number of characters.
    For each character that gets earsed `p` still recognize the words without that character because the atomic expression that matches `a` is either `(a + ε)` or `(… + a + …)*`.
    In the first case, we use `ε` instead of `a`.
    In the second case, we unfold the `*` one time fewer.
* Products are directed:
  - Given `w₁` and `w₂` recognized by `p`, we need to build `w₃` such that `p` recognizes `w₃`, `w₁ ≤ w₃`, and `w₂ ≤ w₃`.
  - Let `n` be the number of atomic expressions in `p`
  - We will need some auxiliary functions:
    * Let `f_p(e, w)` be a function that for an atomic expression `e` in `p` and a word `w` recognized by `p` returns the part of `w` matched by `e`
    * Let `merge(e, w, w′)` be a function that given an atomic expression `e` and two words `w`, `w′` be defined as
      ```
                        ⎧ a    if e = (a + ε)
      merge(e, w, w′) = ⎨
                        ⎩ ww′  if e = (a₁ + … + a_n)*
      ```
      It is easy to show that `w ≤ merge(e, w, w′)`, `w₁ ≤ merge(e, w, w′)`, and `e` recognizes `merge(e, w, w′)`.
  - Let `w₃ = merge(e₁, f_p(e₁, w₁), f_p(e₁, w₂)) merge(e₂, f_p(e₂, w₁), f_p(e₂, w₂)) … merge(e_n, f_p(e_n, w₁), f_p(e_n, w₂))`.

_Proof of the Theorem._
* Downward-closed sets can be represented by a finite union of ideal.
* Products are ideals and the semantics of `+` is the union of languages.

#### Operations on SRE

To use SRE in an analysis we need to compute inclusion of SRE, apply transitions (post), and accelerate sequences of transitions.

Before we explain, the inclusion we can prove the following properties of ideals:

__Lemma.__
Let `I,J,K` be ideals such that `I ⊆ J ∪ K` then `I ⊆ J` or `I ⊆ K`.

_Proof._
- By contradiction, assume that `¬(I ⊆ J)` and `¬(I ⊆ K)`
- Because `¬(I ⊆ J)` and `I ⊆ J ∪ K`, we have `x ∈ I ∖ J`
- Because `¬(I ⊆ K)` and `I ⊆ J ∪ K`, we have `y ∈ I ∖ K`
- Because `I` is directed, we have `z ∈ I` and `x ≤ z` and `y ≤ z`.
- Since `z ∈ I ⊆ J ∪ K` we have `z ∈ J` or `z ∈ K`
  * if `z ∈ J` then `x ∈ J` which is a contradiction
  * if `z ∈ K` then `y ∈ K` which is a contradiction

__Inclusion.__
The lemma above tells us that to compare SRE, we need to check the inclusion of products.

Products are the concatenation of atomic expressions, so we first need to compare atomic expressions:
- `(a + ε) ≤ (b + ε)` if `a = b`
- `(a + ε) ≤ (b₁ + … + b_n)*` iff `∃ i∈[1;n]. a = b_i`
- `(a₁ + … + a_n)* ≤ (b₁ + … + b_m)*` with `∀ i∈[1;n]. ∃ j∈[1;m] a_i = b_j`

Two products `p₁` and `p₂` can be compared using a greedy algorithm:
- `(a+ε) p₁ ≤ (a+ε) p₂` if `p₁ ≤ p₂`
- `e₁ p₁ ≤ e₂ p₂` if `e₁ ≰ e₂ ∧  e₁ p₁ ≤ p₂`
- `e₁ p₁ ≤ (a₁ + …)* p₂` if `e₁ ≤ (a₁ + …)* ∧  p₁ ≤ (a₁ + …)* p₂`
- `ε ≤ p₂`
- if none of the above apply then `p₁ ≰ p₂`

At each step we remove one atomic expression from either product so the algorithm is linear in the size of the products.
The inclusion of two SREs is quadratic time in the size of the SREs.

_Example._
We can check that `(0+ε)(1+2)* ≤ (1+ε)0*(1+2)*` with the following steps
- `(0+ε)(1+2)* ≤ (1+ε)0*(1+2)*` (initial goal)
- `(0+ε)(1+2)* ≤ 0*(1+2)*` (because `(0+ε) ≰ (1+ε)`)
- `(1+2)* ≤ 0*(1+2)*` (because `(0+ε) ≤ 0*`)
- `(1+2)* ≤ (1+2)*` (because `(1+2)* ≰ 0*`)
- `ε ≤ (1+2)*` (because `(1+2)* ≤ (1+2)*`)
- `true`


__Post.__
In order to apply lift the transitions rules of LCS to SRE, we need to work out the effect of send and receive on products.
Since SRE are downward-closed, we can ignore the rule that drop messages.
Then, we can apply the operation to all the products to get the effect on the SRE.

Let `p` be a product, we need to case split on the action:
* case `!a`:
  - if `p = p′ (… + a + …)*` then return `p`
  - else return `p (a+ε)`
* case `?a`:
  - if `p = (a+ε) p′` then return `p′`
  - else if  `p = (… + a + …)* p′` then return `p`
  - else if `p = e p′` then drop `e` and compute the effect of `?a` on `p′`
  - else `?a` cannot apply

Computing the effect of `!a` or `?a` can be computed in linear time.

_Example._
Let us look at `(1+ε)0*(1+2)*` and the following operations: `!1`, `!0`, `?1`, and `?0`.
The results are:
* after `!0` we get `(1+ε)0*(1+2)*(0+ε)`
* after `!1` we get `(1+ε)0*(1+2)*(1+ε) = (1+ε)0*(1+2)*`
* after `?1` we get `0*(1+2)*`
* after `?0` we get `0*(1+2)*`
* after `?0;?0` we get `0*(1+2)*`


__Acceleration.__

Let `Ops` be a sequence of operations `Ops = op₁ op₂ … op_n` where each `op ∈ {?,!} × Σ`.
We denote by `Ops?` the subsequence of receive operations in `Ops` and `Ops!` for the send.

Let `p = e₁ + … + e_m` be a product composed of `m` atomic expressions.

Computing the effect of accelerating `Ops` on `p` checks the following under the assumption that `⇒(p, Ops, p′) ∧ p ≤ p′` (simplified version of the acceleration in [On-the-Fly Analysis of Systems with Unbounded, Lossy Fifo Channels](https://www.irif.fr/~abou/lcs-cav98.ps.gz)):
* try to apply `m+1` time `Ops?` to `p`
  - if it is possible and result in `p′` then `Ops?` is empty or `p′` starts with a atom of the form `(a+…)*` which contains all the received messages.
    + let `{b₁, b₂, …, b_k}` be the set of messages in `Ops!`
    + return `p′ (b₁ + b₂ + … + b_k)*`
  - otherwise `p` eventually gets fully consumed by `Ops?` and we need only to look at `Ops?` and `Ops!`
    + try to apply `m+1` time `Ops` to `p` to get `p′` and once more to get `p′`
    * if `p′ = p″` (the resulting product has stabilized) return `p′`
    + otherwise more messages are put in the channel than received, let `{b₁, b₂, …, b_k}` be the set of messages in `Ops!` return `(b₁ + b₂ + … + b_k)*`

_Example._
- starting from `a*` and accelerating with `?a;!a;!b` we get `a*(a+b)* = (a+b)*` (case where the current content of the channel is sufficient of the receive)
- starting from `(a+ε)` and accelerating with `!c;?a;!a;!b` we get `(b+ε)(c+ε)(a+ε)(b+ε)` (case where the current content of the channel is fully consumed by the receive but the channel stays bounded)
- starting from `ε` and accelerating with `!a;?a;!a` we get `a*` (case where the current content of the channel is fully consumed by the receive but the channel keeps growing)


### Applying the ideal KM tree algorithm

SRE have order-type `ω^|Σ|`, i.e., `ω^ω` is the supremum.
This means the levels of ideals is not finite.

We can construct such sequences with
- `Σ = {a}` gives the sequence `a^ω` which has length `ω`
- `Σ = {a,b}` gives the sequence `(a^ωb)^ω` which has length `ω²`
- `Σ = {a,b,c}` gives the sequence `(((a^ωb)^ω)c)^ω` which has length `ω³`
- …

Therefore, the ideal KM tree algorithm may not converge for LCS as it needs a finite order-type.

Furthermore, coverability is decidable but computing the covering set is not.


# Equivalence of processes: simulation, symmetric simulation, and bisimulation

Until now, we have discuss properties of systems through the lens of reachability properties, e.g., can a system get to a particular state.

Other types of questions we may want to ask  are
* How does a system interact with his environment? (its input/output behaviors)
* What it means for two systems to be equivalent? or implement the same interface?

Surely, two different implementations of the same protocol can have different states, so comparing them using state-based properties is not possible.
Simulation relations for labeled systems try to answer such questions.

## Labeled Transition Systems

A _labeled transition systems_ (LTS) is a triple `(S,Σ,→)` with:
* `S` is a set of states (can be infinite),
* `Σ` is a finite set of labels (the alphabet),
* `→ ⊆ S × Σ × S` is a transition relation.

## Simulation relations

We already saw an instance of simulation with the compatibility of WSTS.
In this case, it was a particular case of simulation relation within the same process.
However, this idea is more general and applicable to different processes.

Let `A`, `B` be two LTS with the same alphabet `Σ`.
A _simulation relation_ `R` a relation between the states of `A` and `B` with the following property:
`∀ a ∈ Σ, s_A,t_A ∈ S_A, s_B ∈ S_B. R(s_A, s_B) ∧ →_A(s_A, a, t_A) ⇒ ∃ t_B ∈ S_B. →_B(s_B, a, t_B) ∧ R(t_A, t_B)`.

If both `R` and its inverse `R⁻¹` are simulation relations then `R` is a bisimulation.

We say that `A` simulates `B` if there is a simulation relation between `B` and `A` that covers all the reachable states of `B` and relates the initials states of `A` and `B`.

For two systems `A` and `B`, it is possible to have `A` simulating `B`, `B` simulating `A`, and `A`,`B` are not bisimilar.

__Example.__
Let us look at the following NFAs:
* `A`:
  ```
        a
  → (a) → (d) ↺ a, b
     ↓ a
    (b)
   a ⇅ b
    (c)
  ```
* `B`:
  ```
        a
  → (0) → (3) ↺ a, b
     ↓ a
    (1)
   b ⇅ a
    (2)
  ```

`A` simulates `B` with the following simulation relation: `{(0,a), (1,d), (2,d), (3,d)}`.

`B` simulates `A` with the following simulation relation: `{(a,0), (b,3), (c,3), (d,3)}`.

However, `A` and `B` are not bisimilar.
