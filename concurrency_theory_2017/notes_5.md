# Forward Analysis of WSTS

This is largely based on [Forward Analysis for WSTS, Part III: Karp-Miller Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07258).

Usually, forward search is more efficient than backward search.
This explains why people are still searching from generic forward algorithm for WSTS.
The Karp-Miller tree was introduced in 1969.
Work on generalizing it is still ongoing.


## Labelled TS

Compared to previous week, we are going for a definition of WSTS that includes labeling on the transitions.

A _labeled WSTS_ is a 4 tuple `(S,Σ,→,≤)` with:
* `S` is a set of states (can be infinite),
* `Σ` is a finite set of labels,
* `→ ⊆ S × Σ × S` is a transition relation,
* `≤` is a WQO over `S`,
* strong monotonicity: `∀ x₁ a x₂ y₁. ∃ y₂. →(x₁, a, x₂) ∧ x₁ ≤ y₁ ∧ →(y₁, a, y₂) ∧ x₂ ≤ y₂`.

For the transitions, we write `→(x₁, a, x₂)` or `x₁ →_a x₂` for `(x₁, a, x₂) ∈ →`.

The transition relation generalizes from single labels to words with the following inductive definition:
```
               ⎧ x₁ = x₂                        if w = ε
→(x₁, w, x₂) = ⎨
               ⎩ →(x₁, a, x′) ∧ →(x′, w′, x₂)   if w = a w′
```

It is possible to relax the definition of strong monotonicity to the simple monotonicity.
This is not needed unless the system has silent transitions, usually written `τ`.

A labeled WSTS has _strong-strict monotonicity_ is it has strong monotonicity and at the same time: `∀ x₁ a x₂ y₁. ∃ y₂. →(x₁, a, x₂) ∧ x₁ < y₁ ∧ →(y₁, a, y₂) ∧ x₂ < y₂`.

For simplicity, in this documents we write WSTS for labeled WSTS.

### Example

Consider the following transfer net with labelled transitions:
```
   2
    ↙ |a ↖
(∙) ⇒ |b ⇒ ( )
    ↘ |c ↗
```

We have:
* `(1,0) →_b (0,1) →_a (2,0)`
* `(1,0) →_c (0,1) →_a (2,0)`
From `(1,0)` to `(2,0)`, `ba` and `ca` are the same.
However, if we want to iterate that sequence they will diverge:
* `(2,0) →_b (0,2) →_a (2,1)`
* `(2,0) →_c (1,1) →_a (3,0)`


## Manipulating downward-closed sets

A set `S` is _directed_ iff `∀ x,y ∈ S. ∃ z ∈ S. x ≤ z ∧ y ≤ z`.

A set `S` is an _ideal_ iff it is downward-closed and directed.

We denote by `Idl(X)` the set of all ideals in `X`.

As elements can form basis for upward-closed sets, it is possible to decompose downward-closed sets in a finite number of ideals.

__Theorem.__
If `(X,≤)` is a WQO and `D = ↓D` then `∃ I₀ … I_n ∈ Idl(X). D = I₀ ∪ … ∪ I_n`.

_Proof._
By contradiction, assume that there is no such sequence.
We have two cases:
* It is not possible to decompose `D` into ideals.
  `⋃_{d ∈ D} ↓d` is a trivial (but potentially infinite) decomposition into ideals, so this case cannot happen.
* It is only possible to decompose `D` into an infinite number of ideals (`I₀ I₁ …`).
  - Without loss of generality, assumes that `∀ i,j. i≠j ⇒ I_i ⊈ I_j`.
  - From the sequence of ideals, we can create a sequence of elements `x₀ x₁ …` such that `∀ i,j. x_i ∈ I_i ∧ (i≠j ⇒ x_i ∉ I_j)`.
  - By definition of downward-closed, `∀ i,j. i≠j ⇒ x_i ≰ x_j ∧ x_j ≰ x_i`.
  - Therefore, `x₀ x₁ …` is an infinite antichain and it contradicts the hypothesis.

While this proof is quite simple it is not constructive, constructive proof are more involved.
See Theorem 3.3 in [Well Behaved Transition Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.02636.pdf) such a proof.


### Ideals as limits

We can decompose downward-closed sets into a finite number of ideal, but each ideal can still be an infinite set.
To make it possible to use ideals, we need to give a "finite representation of each ideal".

In the case of Petri nets, we can use `(ℕ + ω)^n` to represent ideals.
For instance, in the Karp-Miller algorithm a generalized marking `(1 2 ω)` represents the ideal `↓1 × ↓2 × ℕ`.

To have an efficient representation of downward-closed set, we want to decomposed them in maximal ideals: `IdealDecomposition(D) = { I | I ∈ Idl(X) ∧ I ⊆ D ∧ (∀ J ∈ Idl(X). I≠J ∧ J ⊆ D ⇒ I ⊈ J)}`.

By the theorem above, it exists and must be finite.


### ω²-WQO and BQO

Unfortunately, WQO are not "closed" under infinitary operations, e.g., powerset, infinite trees, lexicographic ordering over strings.


#### Ordering on sets

When discussing sets of ordered elements, there are multiple ways to lift the ordering of the elements to the sets.

__Downward-closed sets.__
When we deal with downward-closed sets, the subset ordering (`⊆`) is the most common approach.

It is `↓P ⊆ ↓Q  ⇔  ∀ p ∈ P. ∃ q ∈ Q. p ≤ q.`
When we manipulate downward-closed sets as a finite union of ideal, it means that every ideal of `P` is contained in an ideal of `Q`.

__Upward-closed sets.__

In the case of upward-closed sets, we have: `↑P ⊆ ↑Q` iff `∀ p ∈ P. ∃ q ∈ Q. q ≤ p`.

This lead to the more general operators: `Q ⊑ P` iff `∀ p ∈ P. ∃ q ∈ Q. q ≤ p`.
Notice that the order of `P` and `Q` is swapped.

The `⊑` applies on any kind of sets, not only upward-closed.

__Proposition.__
For any upward-closed sets `P` and `Q`, `Q ⊑ P  ⇔  P ⊆ Q`.

(small digression)

#### Relation ship between `⊑` and logic

It is possible to see a logical proposition with a single free variable `P` as a set: `[P] = { x | P(x) }`.

Then the formula `(∀x. P(x) ⇒ Q(x))` is equivalent to `[Q] ⊆ [P]`. (Notice that the `P`/`Q` order is swapped.)

However, often `P` and `Q` have more than a single free variable.
For instance `P(x,y)` and `Q(x,z)`.

Then `[Q] ⊆ [P]` becomes
* `∀ x. (∃ y. P(x,y)) ⇒ (∃ z. Q(x,z))`
* `∀ x y. ∃ z. P(x,y) ⇒ Q(x,z)`

`[P] ⊑ [Q]` is a stronger relation that means
* `∀ x z. ∃ y. P(x,y) ⇒ Q(x,z)`
* `∀ x. (∀ y. P(x,y)) ⇒ (∀ z. Q(x,z))`

In particular we have `[P] ⊑ [Q]` implies `[Q] ⊆ [P]` and it is well-behaved w.r.t. `∪` and `∨`: `⋃_i[P_i] ⊑ ⋃_j[Q_j]` implies `[∨_j Q_j] ⊆ [∨_i P_i]`.

Some authors have tried to introduce a more uniform notation:
* `X ≼_∀^∃ Y  ⇔  ∀ x ∈ X. ∃ y ∈ Y. x ≤ y  ≈  Y ⊆ X`
* `X ≼_∃^∀ Y  ⇔  ∀ y ∈ Y. ∃ x ∈ X. x ≤ y  ⇔  X ⊑ Y`

`⊑` is useful because
* `⊑` is a closer match to logical implication than `⊆` (think about using `≤` as logical entailment).
* if `⊑` has nice properties, e.g., WQO, it can be used to prove results about hardness/decidability of some proof systems.

#### Rado structure

Let `X_R = {(m, n) ∈ ℕ² | m < n}`.

Visually this space is the region covered by `·` in the plot:
```
⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋮
3 · · ·
2 · ·
1 ·
0
  0 1 2 3 ⋯
```

Let `(m₀,n₀) ≤_R (m₁,n₁)` iff `(m₀=m₁ ∧ n₀≤n₁) ∨ n₀<m₁`.

For instance, `↑(1,3)` corresponds to the element marked by `x`:
```
⋮   ⋮     ⋮ ⋮ ⋮  
7 · x · · x x x  
6 · x · · x x  
5 · x · · x  
4 · x · ·  
3 · x ·  
2 · ·
1 ·
0
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 ⋯
```

__Proposition.__
`(X_R, ≤_R)` is a WQO.

_Proof._
* By contradiction, assume a bad sequence `(a₀,b₀) (a₁,b₁) …`.
* By definition of `≤_R` and bad sequence: `∀ j>0. a_j ≤ b₀`
* Since, we have finitely many values smaller than `b₀`, there is an infinite subsequence `(b,b_{i₀}) (b,b_{i₁}) (b,b_{i₂}) …` for some `b ≤ b₀`.
* Since `(ℕ,≤)` is a WQO we have `k<l` such that `b_{i_k} ≤ b_{i_l}`.
* Therefore, `(b,b_{i_k}) ≤_R (b,b_{i_l})` which is a contradiction.


Let us look at sets of elements.
In particular, consider the following set `ψ_i = ⋃_{0≤k<i} ↑(k,i)`.

Visually `ψ_2` looks like:
```
⋮ ⋮ ⋮   ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋮  
7 x x · x x x x  
6 x x · x x x  
5 x x · x x  
4 x x · x  
3 x x ·  
2 x x
1 ·
0
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 ⋯
```

Visually `ψ_3` looks like:
```
⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋮   ⋮ ⋮ ⋮  
7 x x x · x x x  
6 x x x · x x  
5 x x x · x  
4 x x x ·  
3 x x x  
2 · ·
1 ·
0
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 ⋯
```

__Proposition.__
`∀ i j. (i,j) ∉ ψ_i`.

_Proof._
* `∀ (k,i). (k,i) ∈ ψ_i ⇒ k<i`
* `ψ_i = ⋃_{0≤k<i} ↑(k,i)` so we need to show that `∀ k<i. (k,i) ≰_R (i,j)`
* By definition of `≤_R`, `∀ k<i. ¬( (k=i ∧ i≤j) ∨ i<i )` which is true.

__Proposition.__
`∀ i j k. k < k ⇒ (i,j) ∉ ψ_k`.

_Proof._
* `ψ_k = ⋃_{0≤l<k} ↑(l,k)` so we need to show that `∀ l<k, i<j<k. (l,k) ≰_R (i,j)`
* By definition of `≤_R`, `∀ l<k, i<j<k. ¬ ( (l=i ∧ k≤j) ∨ k<i )`.
* This simplifies to `∀ l<k, i<j<k. ¬ ( (l=i ∧ ⊥) ∨ ⊥ )` which is true.

__Lemma.__
`ψ₁ ψ₂ …` is an finite antichain according to set inclusion (`⊆`).

_Proof._
* Consider `ψ_i` and `ψ_j` with `i<j`.
* `ψ_j ⊈ ψ_i`
  - `(i,j) ∈ ψ_j` because `ψ_j = ⋃_{0≤k<j} ↑(k,j)` and `0≤i<j`
  - `(i,j) ∉ ψ_i` by the proposition above.
* `ψ_i ⊈ ψ_j`
  - `(i-1,i) ∈ ψ_i` because `ψ_i = ⋃_{0≤k<i} ↑(k,i)`, `0≤i-1<i`, and `i≥1`
  - `(i-1,i) ∉ ψ_j` by the proposition above


__Corollary.__
`(2^X,⊆)` is not a WQO.


For `X,Y ⊆ 2^{X_R}`, let `X ⊑_R Y` iff `∀ y ∈ Y. ∃ x ∈ X. x ≤_R y`.

__Corollary.__
`(2^X,⊑_R)` is not a WQO.

_Proof._
* notice that `↑X ⊑_R ↑Y` implies `↑Y ⊆ ↑X`
* `↑ψ_i = ψ_i`
* Therefore, `ψ₁ ψ₂ …` is a bad sequence.


More details in [Better is Better than Well: On Efficient Verification of Infinite-State Systems](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.25.7970).


#### BQO

BQO are a subclass of WQO closed under infinitary operations.

__Theorems.__
* A BQO is a WQO.
* `(X,≤)` is a BQO then `(X^k,componentwise ordering)` is a BQO.
* `(X,≤)` is a BQO then `(X*,lexicographic ordering)` is a BQO.
* `(X,≤)` is a BQO then `(2^X,⊑)` is a BQO (powerset).

The definition is quite technical so we are skipping it, but is can easily be found online.


#### ω²-WQO

ω²-WQO are WQO which do not embed Rado structure.

__Theorem.__
If `(X,≤)` is a ω²-WQO then `(2^X,⊑)` is a WQO.

__Theorem.__
If `(X,≤)` is a ω²-WQO then `(Idl(X),⊆)` is a WQO.

BQO are ω²-WQO.

## Completion of WSTS

Given a WSTS `(S,Σ,→,≤)` where `≤` is a ω²-WQO, we can define the _completion_ of S as a WSTS `(Idl(S),Σ,⇝,⊆)` such that
`⇝(I, a, J)  ⇔  J ∈ IdealDecomposition(↓post(I,a))`

The completion defines a new WSTS that operates on the ideals of the original system and lift the transition relation to these ideals.

### Properties of the completion


__Proposition.__
Let `𝓢 = (S,Σ,→,≤)` be a WSTS with strong monotonicity and its completion`𝓒 = (Idl(S),Σ,⇝,⊆)`.
```
    ∀ x,y ∈ S, w ∈ Σ*, I ∈ Idl(S). →(x,w,y) ∧ x ∈ I  ⇒  ∃ J ∈ Idl(S). y ∈ J ∧ ⇝(I, w, J)
```

_Proof._
By induction on `w`
- case `w = ε`: `I=J`
- case `w = a w′`:
  * we have `x →_a x′ →_{w′} y`
  * `x′ ∈ post_𝓢(x, a) ⊆ ↓post_𝓢(x, a)`
  * `↓post_𝓢(x, a)` can be decomposed into ideals, one of them containing `x′`. Let call that ideal `I′`.
  * by definition: `⇝(I, a, I′)`
  * by the induction hypothesis: `∃ J ∈ Idl(S). ⇝(I′, w′, J) ∧ y ∈ J`

__Proposition.__
Let `𝓢 = (S,Σ,→,≤)` be a WSTS with strong monotonicity and its completion`𝓒 = (Idl(S),Σ,⇝,⊆)`.
```
    ∀ I,J ∈ Idl(S), w ∈ Σ*. y ∈ S. ⇝(I, w, J) ∧ y ∈ J  ⇒  ∃ x ∈ I. y′ ∈ S. →(x, w, y′) ∧ y ≤ y′
```

_Proof._
By induction on `w`:
- case `w = ε`: `x=y=y′`
- case `w = a w′`:
  * we have `I ⇝_a I′ ⇝_{w′} J`
  * by induction hypothesis: `∃ z y′. z ∈ I′ ∧ y′ ∈ J ∧ y ≤ y′`
  * by definition of `⇝`: `∃ x z′. x ∈ I ∧ z′ ∈ I′ ∧ →(x, a, z′) ∧ z ≤ z′`
  * by strong monotonicity we get `y″` such that  `→(x, w, y″) ∧ y ≤ y′ ≤ y″`

__Theorem.__
Let `𝓢 = (S,Σ,→,≤)` be a WSTS with strong monotonicity and its completion`𝓒 = (Idl(S),Σ,⇝,⊆)`.
```
    ∀ I ∈ Idl(S), w ∈ Σ*. ↓post_𝓢(I, w) = ⋃_{J ∈ post_𝓒(I, w)} J
```

_Proof._
Two parts (`⊆`, `⊇`):
- `↓post_𝓢(I, w) ⊆ ⋃_{J ∈ post_𝓒(I, w)} J`
  * pick `y ∈ ↓post_𝓢(I, w)`
  * by definition, `∃ x y′. x∈I ∧ y≤y′`
  * applying the 1st proposition: there is `J` such that `↓y′ ∈ J` and `⇝(I, w, J)`
  * Therefore, `y ∈ ↓y′ ⊆ J` and `J ∈ post_𝓒(I, w)`
- `⋃_{J ∈ post_𝓒(I, w)} J ⊆ ↓post_𝓢(I, w)`
  * for any `J` pick `y ∈ J` and apply the 2nd proposition: we get `x ∈ I` and `y′` such that `→(x, w, y′) ∧ y ≤ y′`
  * This means `y ∈ ↓post_𝓢(x, w) ⊆ post_𝓢(I, w)`


## Acceleration and "length" of traces

### Ordinal number to compare the length of infinite traces

How long is infinite?
Can two (countably) infinite sequences have different length?

Ordinal numbers can give a more fine-grained measure of length for infinite sequences.
`ω` is the first limit ordinal number, i.e., number without a direct predecessor.

__Remark.__
`ω` as the first limit ordinal is not the same as `ω` the limit element in the KM tree.
This is some unfortunate symbol overloading occurring in the literature.

Let us try to understand how ordinal number works.
The easiest way to think about ordinal number (IMO) is to think of them as sequences and addition is concatenation.
Two numbers are equal if it is possible to find a mapping between them that preserve the sequences' orders.

Let us try to understand why (1) `ω = 1 + ω` and (2) `ω ≠ ω + 1`.

Visually, for (1) the mapping looks like
```
ω     = 1 2 3 4 5 …
        | | | | |
1 + ω = 1 1 2 3 4 …
```

For (2) we get
```
ω     = 1 2 3 4 5 …
        | | | | |
ω + 1 = 1 2 3 4 5 … 1
```
It is not possible to match the last elements while preserving the order.

Let us look at the more complicated examples (3) `ω·2 = ω+ω ≠ ω` and (4) `ω = 2·ω`.

For (3) we have
```
ω   = 1  2  3  4  5  …
      |  |  |  |  |  
ω·2 =⎛1⎞⎛2⎞⎛3⎞⎛4⎞⎛5⎞ … ⎛1⎞⎛2⎞⎛3⎞⎛4⎞⎛5⎞ …
     ⎝0⎠⎝0⎠⎝0⎠⎝0⎠⎝0⎠ … ⎝1⎠⎝1⎠⎝1⎠⎝1⎠⎝1⎠ …
```

For (4) we get
```
ω   = 1  2  3  4  5  6  …
      |  |  |  |  |  |
2·ω =⎛0⎞⎛1⎞⎛0⎞⎛1⎞⎛0⎞⎛1⎞ …
     ⎝1⎠⎝1⎠⎝2⎠⎝2⎠⎝3⎠⎝3⎠ …
```


### Acceleration

An infinite sequence of ideal `I₀ I₁ I₂ …` is an _acceleration candidate_ if `I₀ ⊂ I₁ ⊂ I₂ ⊂ …`.

Let `S = (S,Σ,→,≤)` be a WSTS with completion `C` and `C` has strong-strict monotonicity.
Let `w ∈ Σ*` and `I ∈ Idl(S)`.
The _acceleration_ of `I` under `w` is:
```
                ⎧ ⋃_{k∈ℕ} post_C^k(I,w)     if I ⊂ post_C(I,w)
post_C^∞(I,w) = ⎨
                ⎩ I                         otherwise
```

By definition of `post_C^∞` and `post_C` (`⇝`), the acceleration of an ideal is also an ideal.

Notice that acceleration only does something on acceleration candidates.
We can try to capture what acceleration by ordering ideals in _acceleration levels_ such that acceleration takes an ascending chain from one level and returns an ideal of the next level.

```
            ⎧ Idl(X)    if n = 0
lvl(X, n) = ⎨
            ⎩ { 𝓘 | 𝓘 = ⋃_{k∈ℕ} I_k where I_k ∈ lvl(X, n-1) and I₀ I₁ I₂ … is an acceleration candidate }   if n > 0
```

#### Example
In the case of generalized markings in Petri net, a level of `n` means that the marking contains at least n `ω` elements.

To avoid confusion, we will write `ℕ` instead of `ω` for the limit elements in generalized marking.

Let us look at the following Petri net:
```
| → ( )
  ↗
| → ( )
```

1. If we keep on firing the top transition we get the sequence `(0,0) (1,0) (2,0) …`.
   Since the sequence is always strictly increasing it is an acceleration candidate.
   By taking the union of that chain we get `⋃_{i∈ℕ} (i,0) = (ℕ,0)`.
   To get `(ℕ,0)` from `(0,0)`, we traverse a chain of length `ω`.
2. If we continue be firing the bottom transition we get the sequence `(ℕ,0) (ℕ,1) (ℕ,2) …`.
   Since the sequence is always strictly increasing it is an acceleration candidate.
   By taking the union of that chain we get `⋃_{i∈ℕ} (ℕ,i) = (ℕ,ℕ)`.
   To get `(ℕ,ℕ)` from `(ℕ,0)`, we traverse a chain of length `ω`.
3. If we keep on firing the bottom transition from the start we get the sequence `(0,0) (1,1) (2,2) …`.
   Since the sequence is always strictly increasing it is an acceleration candidate.
   By taking the union of that chain we get `⋃_{i∈ℕ} (i,i) = (ℕ,ℕ)`.
   To get `(ℕ,ℕ)` from `(0,0)`, we traverse a chain of length `ω`.

Acceleration can make different of amount of progress depending on the transitions.
If we take (1) and (2) it takes `ω⋅2` steps to saturate the system.
On the other hand, if we follow (3) `ω` steps is enough.

The goal of acceleration levels is to bound the number of time we need to accelerate.
Intuitively, levels bound the length of the longest strictly increasing chain between any two ideals.
In particular, if `X` has a finite number of levels that length is less than ω².

In the case of Petri net, the maximum level is directly connected to the number of places.
`d` places means `d+1` different levels.


__Proposition.__
Let `S = (X,Σ,→,≤)` be as WSTS with strong monotonicity and `C` its completion.
If `C` is deterministic and has strong-strict monotonicity then
1. `∀ I ∈ Idl(X), w ∈ Σ⁺. post_C(I, w) ≠ ∅ ∧ I ∈ lvl(X, n) ⇒ post_C(I, w) ∈ lvl(X, n)`
2. `∀ I ∈ Idl(X), w ∈ Σ⁺. I ⊂ post_C(I, w) ∧ I ∈ lvl(X, n) ⇒ post_C^∞(I, w) ∈ lvl(X, n+1)`

The proof can be found in [Forward Analysis for WSTS, Part III: Karp-Miller Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07258).

### Ideal Karp-Miller Tree

A _very-WSTS_ `S` is a WSTS such that:
* `S` is strongly monotonic
* the completion of `S` is a deterministic WSTS with strong-strict monotonicity
* `Idl(X)` has finitely many acceleration levels.

__Computational requirements.__
1. ideals can be effectively manipulated (union, ideal decomposition, membership, inclusion, …)
2. `post_C` is computable where `C` is the completion of `S`
3. `post_C^∞` is computable where `C` is the completion of `S`

The first two requirements define the class of _completion-post-effective_ WSTS.
The last requirement define the class of _∞-completion-effective_ WSTS.

```
Input: very-WSTS 𝓢 completion-post-effective and ∞-completion-effective, initial state s₀
Output: the covering set of 𝓢

𝓒 := the completion of 𝓢
I₀ := ↓s₀

initialize a tree T with an unmarked node/root (I₀, 0) //I₀ is an ideal, 0 is the level

while T contains an unmarked node c: (I, n) do
    if c has an ancestor (I′, n′) s.t. I′ = I then mark c
    else
        if c has an ancestor c′: (I′, n′) s.t. I′ ⊂ I  ∧  n′ = n
            w ← sequence of labels from c′ to c
            replace c: (I, n) by (post_𝓒^∞(I, w), n + 1)
        for a ∈ Σ do
            for J ∈ post_𝓒(I, a)
                T := T ∪ ((I,n), a, (J,n))
        mark c
return ⋃_{(I,n) ∈ T} I
```

__Sketch of the correctness of the algorithm.__
* The algorithm terminates because we assume a finite number of acceleration levels.
* The properties of the completion implies it is computing the covering set.

The proof of correctness can be found in [Forward Analysis for WSTS, Part III: Karp-Miller Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07258).

This algorithm terminates on "flat" systems, i.e., acceleration only on simple cycles, not nested cycles.
However, the analysis of non-flat systems is still a ongoing subject of research.
Later in this class, we will discuss about lossy channel systems and depth-bounded processes.
For both types of system, we know what the completion is (simple regular expressions, and nested graphs), but both types of systems are not flat.
